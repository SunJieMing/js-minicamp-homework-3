    Objects

	Objects encapsulate data and functions together. They can contain many data members and also function members.
	You access each function and data member by their name.

    Properties

	The properties of an object are the data that an object encapsulates. They are the objects variables.
	
    Methods

	The methods of an object are the functions that an object encapsulates. They are the object's member
	functions.

    for in loop

	The for in loop is like iterating over all the properties of an object. You can execute some piece of code
	for each property of an object.

    Dot notation vs bracket notation
	
	Bracket notation and dot notation are two different ways to access the properties of an object. Bracket
	notation is needed when properties of an object do not have a valid variable name. If
	the variable name is good, then you can use dot notation.
