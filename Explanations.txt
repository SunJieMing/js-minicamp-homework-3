Objects: Objects are a way to hold and categorize information. They are a way
to collect properties. Each property can either be an association between a key
and a value, or a method.

----------------------------------------------------------

Properties: A property is a way to describe something. For example, if you have a
"car" object, you may want to have a property that describes the car's color or how
many doors it has. Also, you may have another property that describes something the
car does. For example, you could have a function that describes the sequence of events
as the car is started (car.pressBrake(), car.turnKey(), car.startEngine()). 

----------------------------------------------------------

Methods: A method is an action (or a collection of actions) grouped under a single function
to complete a task. For example, you could have a method called sum() that takes two parameters and
adds them.

----------------------------------------------------------

for in loop: A for in loop is a way to iterate over values and perform an action. You could
iterate over array values and add five to each odd number, or iterate over each property in
an object. It is a very versatile way to efficiently perform a large action set without
using verbose language.


----------------------------------------------------------

dot notation vs bracket notation: In some cases, dot notation and bracket notation are
equivalent, such as using console.log vs console[log]. When a variable is unknown, such as
on a webpage where a user interacts by entering variables into the field linked to a method,
it is often better to use bracket notation because it will consider the value, as opposed to
the literal string entered.
