# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Objects = Objects are like variables but they contain many key/value pairs inside of them which can be accessed separately. We can picture this as a dictionary, with many properties which are the actual name and definition of that name.
	* Properties = Properties in objects are the key/value pairs. For example I can assign a key/value of my name and age in a object like name: 'Mario', age: 25.
	* Methods = Methods are functions inside of objects. We can take these methods and perform actions and make our object do something.
	* for in loop = We use the for in loop to loop through properties of an object.
	* Dot notation vs bracket notation = We use dot notation or bracket notation to gain access to the properties in our objects. Dot notation is much easier to read than bracket notation so it's used more often.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.

	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
